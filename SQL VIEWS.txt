-- If you want to change the structure of a view then use ALTER VIEW command:
alter view order_summary rename to customer_order_summary;
alter view customer_order_summary rename to order_summary;
alter view order_summary rename column ord_id to order_id;


			-- Drop a view using:--

drop view order_summary;



		-- Advantages of using a view:--

1) Security:
2) Simplify complex SQL Queries:

There can be other advantages as well but these I think are the most important ones.

To showcase Security,
lets create a role for our vendor and then give only select access to our view in this role.

CREATE ROLE vendor
LOGIN
PASSWORD 'vendor';

SELECT rolname FROM pg_roles;

GRANT SELECT
ON order_summary
TO vendor;
