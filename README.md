# SQLPortfolio
Welcome to my SQL repository on GitHub! This repository is a treasure trove of SQL knowledge, designed to help you master this powerful programming language. Whether you're just starting out with SQL or you're an experienced user looking to brush up on your skills, these files have something for everyone.

The repository includes multiple SQL files covering a wide range of topics, from basic SQL queries to more advanced features like SQL window functions, SQL views, SQL triggers, SQL pivot and unpivot, and even some challenging code files to test your skills.

The basic-sql-queries.sql file is a great starting point for anyone new to SQL, as it covers the basics of SQL queries, including selecting data, filtering data, and sorting data. From there, you can move on to more advanced topics like SQL joins, which are explored in the sql-joins.sql file. This file dives into the different types of SQL joins, such as inner join, left join, and right join, and demonstrates how they can be used to combine data from multiple tables.

The sql-case-statements.sql file takes things a step further, discussing the SQL case statement and how it can be used to transform data. The sql-subqueries.sql file introduces the concept of subqueries in SQL and demonstrates how they can be used to query data from multiple tables.

The sql-window-functions.sql file is another advanced topic, introducing the concept of SQL window functions and demonstrating how they can be used to perform complex calculations on a subset of data. The sql-views.sql file covers SQL views and how they can be used to simplify complex queries and improve performance, while the sql-triggers.sql file discusses SQL triggers and how they can be used to enforce data integrity and automate tasks.

Finally, the sql-pivot-unpivot.sql file demonstrates how SQL pivot and unpivot can be used to transform data from rows to columns and vice versa, making it a great resource for anyone working with large datasets.

And if you're up for a challenge, the repository even includes two code files with challenging problems to test your SQL skills and knowledge.

In short, this SQL repository on GitHub is a must-visit for anyone looking to improve their SQL skills and take their data analysis to the next level.
