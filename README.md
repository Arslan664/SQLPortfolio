# SQLPortfolio
Welcome to my SQL repository on GitHub! This repository contains multiple SQL files that cover a wide range of SQL topics, from basic SQL queries to more advanced features like SQL window functions, SQL views, SQL triggers, SQL pivot and unpivot, and challenge code files.

If you're just starting out with SQL, these files provide a solid foundation to build your knowledge of this popular programming language. For more experienced users, these files can serve as a useful reference or a way to brush up on SQL basics.

Here's an overview of the files included in this repository:

basic-sql-queries.sql: 
Covers the basics of SQL queries, including selecting data, filtering data, and sorting data.
sql-joins.sql:
 Explores the different types of SQL joins, such as inner join, left join, and right join.
sql-case-statements.sql: 
Discusses the SQL case statement and how it can be used to transform data.
sql-subqueries.sql: 
Introduces the concept of subqueries in SQL and demonstrates how they can be used to query data from multiple tables.
sql-window-functions.sql:
 Introduces the concept of SQL window functions and demonstrates how they can be used to perform complex calculations on a subset of data.
sql-views.sql:
